# Predicting what user reviews are about with Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis

A few years ago, I was searching for a treatment for skin and found a website called [Realself](https://www.realself.com). It's the best source of information for those who are planning to do some aesthetic procedure, where thousands of users share their experience on treatments, like writing a diary. 

After reading many reviews, I found four different treatments that offered similar outcomes based in the before and after pictures and chose the one that required less sessions to achieve the desired result. It was the most expensive and with longer downtime, however, provided faster results.

There are two different types of reviews in Realself: (1) for doctors and (2) for procedures. Pacients review doctors for 9 different categories and procedures for 1 category ("worth it", "not worth it" or "not sure"), as you can see in the image below.

So I thought it would be interesting to uncover what customers talk more about in those long posts. For this task, I used a topic modelling method called [Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation), a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool that can automatically identify topics from a corpus. A “topic” consists of a group of words that frequently occur together. 

The next step was to predict how the users would rate their experience on those topics, in other words, I simulated the ratings for the potential subcategories of the procedures, such as for the doctors' reviews, based on user's sentiments. I used [Textblob](textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) Sentiment for classifying each sentence of the posts as "negative" or "positive".

### Project Pipeline

#### 1. Data Collection

I extracted all posts (53,547 posts from 17,270 unique users) of all reviews from 3 different procedures:

* Botox
* Rhinoplasty
* Coolsculpting

#### 2. LDA to identify "hidden" topics

I experiemented with different topic modelling techniques: LDA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and k-means, and LDA provided better results. It assumes that a corpus of text documents cover a collection of topics. Each topic is defined as a multinomial distribution over a word dictionary with words drawn from a [Dirichlet distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution).

#### 3. Sentiment Analysis to assign ratings for topics

One possible approach to define the rating for the topic is the percent of posts that gave a positive comment in each treatment, similar to Rotten Tomatoes scores. For this task I tried Vader and TextBlob
