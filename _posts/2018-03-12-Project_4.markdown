Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis on Aesthetic Procedure Reviews

Predicting hidden topic ratings based on users sentiments

"It is becoming increasingly difficult to handle the large number of opinions posted on review platforms and at the same time offer this information in a useful way to each user so he or she can make a decision fast whether to buy the product or not. Topic-based aggregations and short review summaries are used to group and condense what other users think about the product in order to personalize the content served to a new user and shorten the time he needs to make a buying decision."
