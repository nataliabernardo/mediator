## Predicting what user reviews are about with Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis

Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis on Aesthetic Procedure Reviews
Predicting hidden topic ratings based on users sentiments

"It is becoming increasingly difficult to handle the large number of opinions posted on review platforms and at the same time offer this information in a useful way to each user so he or she can make a decision fast whether to buy the product or not. Topic-based aggregations and short review summaries are used to group and condense what other users think about the product in order to personalize the content served to a new user and shorten the time he needs to make a buying decision."

A few years ago, I was searching for a treatment for skin and found a website called [Realself](https://www.realself.com). It's the best source of information for those who are planning to do some aesthetic procedure, where thousands of users share their experience on treatments, like writing a diary. After reading many reviews, I found four different treatments that provided similar outcomes based in the before and after pictures and chose the one that required less sessions to achieve the desired result.
